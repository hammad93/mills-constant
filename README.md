# Jupyter Notebook

A Jupyter notebook is included in the `notebooks` directory which can reproduce both the original 555,153 digits of the Mills constant and the provided 1,665,461 digits. In the directory, there are also 2 text files, `A_14.txt` and `A_13.txt`, that are the direct outputs of the notebook and represent the Mills constants computed with the 13th Mills PRP and 14th Mills PRP. They can be considered duplicates.
