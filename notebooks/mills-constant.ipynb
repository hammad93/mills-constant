    "\n",
    "Before continuing, we formulate a method to recreate the accepted Mill's constant. Per the original README.md, **\"Computed using the 13th Mills PRP. Verified using the 14th Mills PRP.\"** where the 13th Mills PRP relates to `b_13 = 300840` and `b_14 = 1623568` of the form `b_n`. Provided that the notation here is `A^(c^n)` where c = 3, we can attempt to recreate it with 555153 digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we utilize the mpmath Python library to compute with arbitrary (unlimited) precision. Here are the steps based on the above notation for Mill's constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `A^(3^n) = P_n`\n",
    "  - _P_ is the prime number, related to _n_ and _b_n_.\n",
    "  - We want _A_ (Mill's constant) to equal \"Mills - 555153 Digits.txt\"\n",
    "- `pow(A^(3^n), 1/(3^n)) = pow(P_n, 1/(3^n))`\n",
    "  - We take the _n_-th root on both sides to isolate _A_\n",
    "  - This is the `mpmath.root()` function, see references\n",
    "- `A = pow(P_n, 1/(3^n))`\n",
    "  - Equivalent to `A = mpmath.root(P_n, (3^n))`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we need to understand the precision for the root. The precision is related to the number of digits or _555,153_ in our example. This is where the verification step comes in. It's precise enough to generate the next prime number. It is equivalent to the number of digits in the next generated prime number.\n",
